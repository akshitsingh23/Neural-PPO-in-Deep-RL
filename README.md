# Deep Reinforcement Learning Internship - Neural PPO Algorithm

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the **Neural Proximal Policy Optimization (Neural PPO)** algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm discovered in 2022. During my internship at **IIT Guwahati**, I explored the potential applications of Neural PPO in **complex environments**, such as gaming and real-world simulations. The algorithm shows great promise in achieving more **adaptive decision-making processes** in dynamic and uncertain settings.

## Objectives

1. **Estimate the algorithm's uses in complex environments**:  
   I investigated the scalability and adaptability of Neural PPO in diverse applications, particularly focusing on complex, real-world scenarios like gaming simulations and robotic control.

2. **Evaluate convergence to a global optimal policy**:  
   By making proper assumptions, I analyzed the algorithmâ€™s ability to converge to the best possible policy for various environments, which is essential for optimizing performance in reinforcement learning tasks.

3. **Interest in Reinforcement Learning**:  
   My deep passion for reinforcement learning drove my commitment to understanding and improving the Neural PPO algorithm, further enhancing its effectiveness in solving real-world problems.

## Key Learnings

- **Adaptability of Neural PPO** in multi-agent environments and complex simulations.
- **Optimization of policy convergence** to ensure that the system learns from the environment and attains optimal results efficiently.
- Insights into the **potential applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)** in sectors like gaming, robotics, and autonomous systems.

## Future Work

Neural PPO has potential for further enhancements, particularly in:
- **Multi-agent systems** with cooperative and competitive dynamics.
- **Robust policy training** in environments with varying levels of uncertainty.
- Real-world deployment in **autonomous decision-making systems**.
